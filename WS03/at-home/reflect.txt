//Workshop: 3 At Home

1. In the variables, familyName and givenName are able to hold up to at least 40
characters. In the original w3_at_home.cpp file, have the same 40 characters but 
has a 1 added to it. This 1 has a special purpose because it adds a special character
to the static array called a null terminator. This null terminator is added to the
end of the array in order to notify the end of a string. 

2. The name of the feature to have more than one function with different parameters is
called function overload. This features allows you to have a function with the same name,
the only difference is that it passes different parameters. The function will be able to 
tell which function is which based on the parameters sent. The reason why C gives this
error is because C will notify that more than one function is being declared with the 
same name and purpose.

3. In this workshop, I have learned for the purpose of both using both function overloading
and using Classes. The reason for function overloading is so that you want to have multiple 
of different functions but based on the same purpose. Classes is used as a data type storing 
both data members, any variables or data you declared and member functions, declaring functions
in order to access the private data members.

3. Member functions are used to access private data members that are stored within the class.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

int main (void) {

	char * code = nullptr;

	codeptr = new code[SIZE];

	strcpy (codeptr, "OOP244");

	delete [] codeptr;

	return 0;
